# `max_runtime_s` is the hard cap on the sandbox poll loop; the poll-loop's own
# timeout kills runaway agents. Lowering it below the poll cap shortens the run,
# raising it above the poll cap has no effect (the poll loop wins).
#
# `max_findings` is a soft target — the agent self-limits via the
# `signals-scout-runs-findings-create` idempotency rule plus its own
# "fewer, better" calibration. We don't reject finding emits past the cap; we
# instead read it back via `len(run.findings)` at finalize and surface it as a
# metric for follow-up calibration.

# harness's in-activity poll loop, not the Temporal-enforced timeout). The stale-RUNNING
# self-heal in `runner.py` uses this — not the team's recorded budget — as the staleness
# base, so a team with a generous `max_runtime_s` doesn't get hours of false-blocking
# from an orphaned row.
